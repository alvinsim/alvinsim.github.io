![alvinsim](/images/alvinsim.png) Hi. My name is Alvin Sim.

Throughout my career, which started in 2002, I have worn many hats.

At my first job, I started as a Graphic Designer, working for a small mobile content provider company.

After a year, I changed jobs and did [Classic ASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages) and [ASP.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET) coding in [VB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET). This was the start of my career as a Software Developer.

Moving forward in my career and because of project requirements, I picked-up [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) and have been coding in Java ever since. Besides programming, I also got involved with [Oracle Databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database) and [\*nix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) systems.

Besides writing code, I also like to tinker with [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

For more information on the work I did, you can view my my resume atÂ [my Linkedin profile page](http://my.linkedin.com/pub/alvin-sim/5/a82/8ab) .

Thanks.
