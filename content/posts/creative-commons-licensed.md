Well, this website actually, including the blogs posts. Everything published here is now licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

In short, this means that you are allowed to (including for commercial works)

*   share any of the blog posts published here with anyone.
*   use any of the blog posts to produce any form of works.

There is just one request: Please provide a link back to the content and reference me as the author. You can do it anyway you like, as long as it is visible to people viewing your content.

The main reason I chose to use a license on my website is because I believe anything published or shared needs to have a set of standard terms. These terms tells how the author or content creator wants their work to be shared or re-used.

For more information, you can go to [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) and go through their [FAQ](https://creativecommons.org/faq/). Or you can read more about [Creative Commmons in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons).
