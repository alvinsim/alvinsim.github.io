Most of us now have additional external monitor in our workspace. Having more than one screen, which I find, makes one productive, especially when you need to reference data on another application. Using `Alt` `Tab` to switch between applications is not the best thing to do.

Prior to this, to move a window between monitors, I would use the mouse and drag it to the other screen. I have been doing this for years. I see other people doing this too. Or there is the other option of using `Alt` `Space` `n` and then use the arrow keys to move the window.

But now, I came to find out a Windows keyboard shortcut to do this, which is more efficient — `Win` `Shift` ( `←` / `→` ). This is only available in Windows 7 or higher.

Here are some extra tips. And they are also only for Windows 7 or higher.

*   `Win` ( `←` / `→` ) docks the window to the left/right of the screen.
*   `Win` `↑` maximises and sets the window to focus.
