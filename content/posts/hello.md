I used to blog at [my wordpress site](https://alvinsim.wordpress.com). But now I have decided to merge both [my website](http://www.alvinsim.com/main) and blog since I already have my domain name and hosting. Unfortunately, this was something I had put off for a very long time.

What I will be blogging about?
------------------------------

*   Hacks, things which inspires me and passionate about - coding/scripting, software development/engineering, tech, art, music, my kids.
*   How-to articles especially for my own reference.
*   My doodles (maybe).

Why blogging?
-------------

*   To share things I've learned to everyone in the internet.
*   As my knowledge-base.
