      <description>This has happened to me each time I setup a new Debian or Ubuntu environment. Firstly, the yarn command I am referring to here is the JavaScript &amp;ldquo;Yarn&amp;rdquo; package manager. The yarn that was installed or already installed was the one used by the cmdtest.
I thought I had yarn installed when I checked using the command which yarn and out printed /usr/bin/yarn.

      <description>One day on my way back home, I was listening to one of Hanselminutes&amp;rsquo;s podcast episodes titled &amp;ldquo;Inside Linux on Windows with WSL and Tara Raj&amp;rdquo;.
This reminded me of the first time I tried it when Microsoft first announced it back in 2016. Then, it was called &amp;ldquo;Bash on Windows&amp;rdquo; and Microsoft collaborated with Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu.
Personally, I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it much. It was just another shiny new toy and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a use for it then.</description>
