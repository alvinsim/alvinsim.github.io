      <description>I used to blog at my wordpress site. But now I have decided to merge both my website and blog since I already have my domain name and hosting. Unfortunately, this was something I had put off for a very long time.
What I will be blogging about? Hacks, things which inspires me and passionate about - coding/scripting, software development/engineering, tech, art, music, my kids. How-to articles especially for my own reference.</description>
