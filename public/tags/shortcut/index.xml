      <description>Most of us now have additional external monitor in our workspace. Having more than one screen, which I find, makes one productive, especially when you need to reference data on another application. Using Alt Tab to switch between applications is not the best thing to do.
Prior to this, to move a window between monitors, I would use the mouse and drag it to the other screen. I have been doing this for years.</description>
