      <title>My Experience with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</title>

      <description>One day on my way back home, I was listening to one of Hanselminutes&amp;rsquo;s podcast episodes titled &amp;ldquo;Inside Linux on Windows with WSL and Tara Raj&amp;rdquo;.
This reminded me of the first time I tried it when Microsoft first announced it back in 2016. Then, it was called &amp;ldquo;Bash on Windows&amp;rdquo; and Microsoft collaborated with Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu.
Personally, I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it much. It was just another shiny new toy and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a use for it then.</description>

      <description>Microsoft Windows has this feature called symbolic links since Windows Vista. But, I am guessing not many are aware of this feature, nor did I. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I had a need for it and tried searching if there were any 3rd party applications which provided this feature. And I found this How-To Geek article. Eventually, I found other articles on this subject.
What are symbolic links? Symbolic links are pointers referencing to another file or directory at a different location.</description>

      <description>Starting With Dia When I had to draw UML diagrams, the tool I first used was Dia - an open-sourced diagraming software. Dia is a great tool. I have not used Microsoft Visio before, so I cannot compare what short-comings it has compared to Visio.
The other tool I tried was yEd. I did not feel comfortable using it, and always went back to using Dia.
Couple of years ago, with a new job, I had to draw lots of sequence diagrams.</description>

      <title>Remember Me, Subversion</title>

      <description>Every three months, my workplace&amp;rsquo;s network domain will prompt to change our password. And this tri-monthly exercise would affect all the other intranet sites and systems, namely Subversion (SVN). Now, this is not a major problem because the organisation uses single sign-on via LDAP or Active Directory i.e. you can access the other intanet sites or systems with the same User ID and password.
But recently, I noticed SVN doesn&amp;rsquo;t remember me, even when I clicked on the &amp;ldquo;Save authentication&amp;rdquo; check box at the TortoiseSVN&amp;rsquo;s authentication window.</description>

      <title>Windows Tips - Move Window Between Multiple Monitor(s)</title>
      <link>http://localhost/posts/move-window-between-monitors/</link>

      <description>Most of us now have additional external monitor in our workspace. Having more than one screen, which I find, makes one productive, especially when you need to reference data on another application. Using Alt Tab to switch between applications is not the best thing to do.
Prior to this, to move a window between monitors, I would use the mouse and drag it to the other screen. I have been doing this for years.</description>

Machines are wonderful. They help us to be productive by doing the things we don&amp;rsquo;t want to do or can&amp;rsquo;t do, whilst we can focus on other important things.
Yes, I am LAZY! I write scripts or let services, like IFTTT (If-This-Then-That), to do things for me.
This is how I automate some of my daily routines.</description>

      <description>1. Connect to a (trusted) network After the Windows installation completes successfully, I&amp;rsquo;d connect it to the Internet. This is so that I can update Windows with the latest security patches, and download the necessary applications.
2. Windows Update It is always important to always keep your Windows (or any other OS you use) up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.
3. Check Windows Settings For Windows prior to Windows 10, I would configure Windows Update to notify only and not download.</description>
