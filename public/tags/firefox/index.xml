      <description>When I use a computer, I like to have both hands on the keyboard, or specifically on the home row. I find that it is more productive than having to move them to grab the mouse every few seconds. This is one reason I am grateful for
Software with great keyboard shortcuts and also that are easily customisable. Terminal (or terminal emulator) and command prompt which you do not really need to use the mouse.</description>
