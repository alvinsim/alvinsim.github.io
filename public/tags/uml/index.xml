      <description>Starting With Dia When I had to draw UML diagrams, the tool I first used was Dia - an open-sourced diagraming software. Dia is a great tool. I have not used Microsoft Visio before, so I cannot compare what short-comings it has compared to Visio.
The other tool I tried was yEd. I did not feel comfortable using it, and always went back to using Dia.
Couple of years ago, with a new job, I had to draw lots of sequence diagrams.</description>
